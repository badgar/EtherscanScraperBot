# EtherscanScraperBot
The script scrapes the Verified Contracts tab on etherscan.io every two minutes in search of newly added contracts. Then it filters them out to only return contracts of ERC-20 tokens that have a landing page for the project in the source code. 
The user is notified of new additions through a personal Telegram bot.
